Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engeneering is the use of engeneering skills to design develop and maintain high quality software.It plays a crutial role by enabling creation of software applications and systems that help in various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In the 1980s their was emergence of object oriented programing.Object oriented programing with languages such as smalltalk which introduced the concept of organising software around objects and classes which made things easier
Agile methodologies. In the 2000srise in agile methodologies such as extreme programing which emphasised iterative developnent collaboration and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
DevOps.In 2010 practices that itergrate developmentand operation teams aming to faster and reliable delivary of software through automation and continous intergration


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software product design. It involves plannig, creatig features and figuring out how a software application will interact with its users
Development testing.This is where developers test individual units of their code to make sure the code is correct
Deployment.Getting a software application from the development environment to the live envirinment making it availlable fr users
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
both methodologies have diffrent approches to product management and software development
In waterfall methodology each phase of the progect must be completed before moving to the next.it can be explained in the senario where developing a new banking where the requirements are strictly defined by regulations and unlikely to change, this ensures all regulatory aspects are thorougly adressed before before the progect moves forward while in Agile methodology each phase produces a usable product increment which can be explained in the senario where developing a new social media platform where user preferences and features may envolve rapidly Agile allows for frequent updates and refinements based on user feedback apdating quickly to changes in the market trends

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
intergrated deveopment environments is important in code writting and editing which provides a user friendly interface  for code ane and featureslike syntax highligting coding completion and error detection,for example,Virtual studio code
version control systems is important in branching which enables developers to work on diffrent features or fixes  in separate branches and then merge them into the main progect,for example,git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Bugs.Identifing and fixing bugs esspecially in code basses can be time consuming and frustrating,this can be overcomed by strategies such as using debugging tools such as IDE debuggers to step through code,set breakpoints and inspect variablesr
managing technical code.Accumilation of shortcuts taken on previous phases that need to  be addressed later which can be overcomed by strategies such as setting standards to estsblish guidelines and revive proceces to prevent excessive technical dept

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
